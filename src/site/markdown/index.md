bigqueue
========

A big, fast and persistent queue based on memory mapped file.

###Feature Highlight:  
1. **Fast**: close to the speed of direct memory access, both enqueue and dequeue are close to O(1) memory access.  
2. **Big**: the total size of the queue is only limited by the available disk space.  
3. **Persistent**: all data in the queue is persisted on disk, and is crash resistant.  
4. **Memory-efficient**: automatic paging & swapping algorithm, only most-recently accessed data is kept in memory.  
5. **Thread-safe**: multiple threads can concurrently enqueue and dequeue without data corruption.  
6. **Simple&Light-weight**: current number of source files is 12 and the library jar is less than 30K.

###Performance Highlight:
* In concurrent producing and consuming case, the average throughput is around ***166M bytes per second***.
* In sequential producing then consuming case, the average throughput is around ***333M bytes per second***.

Suppose the average message size is 1KB, then big queue can concurrently producing and consuming  
166K message per second. Basically, the throughput is only limited by disk IO bandwidth.
