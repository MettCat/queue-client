# Big Queue


A big, fast and persistent queue based on memory mapped file.

***Notice***, bigqueue is just a standalone library, for a high-throughput, persistent, distributed, publish-subscrible messaging system, please refer to [Luxun](https://github.com/bulldog2011/luxun), Luxun messaging system uses bigqueue internally as fast and persistent queue. 

##Feature Highlight:  
1. **Fast**: close to the speed of direct memory access, both enqueue and dequeue are close to O(1) memory access.  
2. **Big**: the total size of the queue is only limited by the available disk space.  
3. **Persistent**: all data in the queue is persisted on disk, and is crash resistant.
4. **Reliable**: OS will be responsible to presist the produced messages even your process crashes.  
5. **Realtime**: messages produced by producer threads will be immediately visible to consumer threads.
6. **Memory-efficient**: automatic paging & swapping algorithm, only most-recently accessed data is kept in memory.  
7. **Thread-safe**: multiple threads can concurrently enqueue and dequeue without data corruption.  
8. **Simple&Light-weight**: current number of source files is 12 and the library jar is less than 30K.


## The Big Picture

###Memory Mapped Sliding Window

##Performance Highlight:
* In concurrent producing and consuming case, the average throughput is around ***166M bytes per second***.
* In sequential producing then consuming case, the average throughput is around ***333M bytes per second***.

Suppose the average message size is 1KB, then big queue can concurrently producing and consuming  
166K message per second. Basically, the throughput is only limited by disk IO bandwidth.

##How to Use
1. Direct jar or source reference  
Download jar from repository mentioned in version history section below, latest stable release is [0.7.0](https://github.com/bulldog2011/bulldog-repo/tree/master/repo/releases/com/leansoft/bigqueue/0.7.0).   
***Note*** : bigqueue depends on log4j, please also added log4j jar reference if you use bigqueue.
